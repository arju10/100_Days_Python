Typecaseting: It converts one data type into another data type.

Pythong supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the typecasting in python.

Ther are two types of typecasting:
1. Explicit conversion (Explicit type casting in python): The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer or programmer's intervention or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit type conversion.
It can be achieved with the help of Python’s built-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), str(), etc .

2. Implicit conversion (Implicit type casting in python): THe conversion of one data type into another data type, done via Python’s own automatic type conversion, is called implicit type

a = "1"

print("Type of a: ",type(a))
print("String to int type",int(a))
